                  <p>When considering the cost to install a pickleball court in the DFW area, several factors influence the final investment:</p>
                  
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
                    <li><strong>Court Size:</strong> Standard pickleball courts are 20' x 44', but we can customize dimensions for your property.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surface Material:</strong> Options include acrylic hard court surfaces, cushioned surfaces, or modular tiles at varying price points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Site Preparation:</strong> The current condition of your property affects excavation and base preparation costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Additional Features:</strong> Fencing, lighting, seating, and shade structures add functionality but increase the investment.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Most residential pickleball court installations in DFW range from $25,000 to $45,000 for a complete project with quality materials and professional construction.
